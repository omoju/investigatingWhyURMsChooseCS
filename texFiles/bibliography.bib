     abstract = {Let x and y be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions f and g. A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x's and y's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x's and m y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives $f(x) > g(x)$ for every x.},

@article{Kuhn2000309,
	Abstract = {We propose the coordination of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowing as the essence of what develops in the attainment of mature epistemological understanding. Initially, the objective dimension dominates, to the exclusion of subjectivity; subsequently, the subjective dimension assumes an ascendant position and the objective is abandoned, and, finally, the two are coordinated. This progression, we further postulate, tends to occur in a systematic order across different judgment domains (personal taste, aesthetic, value, and truth), with the orders the reverse of one another in the two major transitions that constitute this progression. These predictions are supported among a sample of seven groups of children, adolescents, and adults varying in age, education, and life experience. Subjectivity is most readily acknowledged in personal taste and aesthetic judgments and least readily in truth judgments. Once subjectivity is accepted and becomes dominant, objectivity is reintegrated in the reverse order, i.e., most readily with respect to truth judgments. Not predicted, however, was the finding that for a number of individuals, both transitions proved most difficult in the values domain. },

@article{SCE:SCE1,
	Abstract = {Basing its arguments in current perspectives on the nature of the scientific enterprise, which see argument and argumentative practice as a core activity of scientists, this article develops the case for the inclusion and central role of argument in science education. Beginning with a review of the nature of argument, it discusses the function and purpose of dialogic argument in the social construction of scientific knowledge and the interpretation of empirical data. The case is then advanced that any education about science, rather than education in science, must give the role of argument a high priority if it is to give a fair account of the social practice of science, and develop a knowledge and understanding of the evaluative criteria used to establish scientific theories. Such knowledge is essential to enhance the public understanding of science and improve scientific literacy. The existing literature, and work that has attempted to use argument within science education, is reviewed to show that classroom practice does provide the opportunity to develop young people's ability to construct argument. Furthermore, the case is advanced that the lack of opportunities for the practice of argument within science classrooms, and lack of teacher's pedagogical skills in organizing argumentative discourse within the classroom are significant impediments to progress in the field. {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	Annote = {Today is the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination. The past week has been jam-packed with images and commentaries on the event. From trhe new book written by the secret service agent who was there when it happened, to the ESPN report regarding the NFL's decision to play games the following Sunday, this week has been a trip down memory lane.

Kennedy's assassination, on November 22, 1963, was the first among five that exposed a critical divide concerning America's communal image.  Medger Evers was killed on June 12, 1963. Malcolm X was killed on February 21, 1965.  Martin Luther King, Jr. died on April 4, 1968, and Robert ``Bobby'' Kennedy, Jr. was killed on June 6, 1968.

It was an era of both domestic and global confusion.  America's persona as the world's body ground against all forms of tyranny was juxtaposed against bloody battles regarding race. The nation was engulfed in redefining its identity.  The melting pot experiment was exposed as a colossal contradiction.

@article{Thibodeau:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The way we talk about complex and abstract ideas is suffused with metaphor. In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make ``well-informed'' decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more ``substantive'' (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations as a new tool for philosophers of science. This philosophical discipline deals with the connections of empirical and theoretical structures. Scientists observe real systems and phenomena and from that they obtain a data structure. To represent that structure they build a model. In this context we say simplistic that there is a "mapping" from reality to theory. The so-called structuralist approach in philosophy of science uses informal logic and informal set theory to axiomatize empirical theories and their intertheoretic relations. It offers two layers of structures: the empirical and the theoretical layer. In this paper we will extend this structuralist view by using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations to represent structures of perceptions as important components in the philosophy of science. These components have to be settled in an intermediate layer between the empirical and theoretical structures.},

We discuss the theoretical background of this approach and evidence that the resulting curricula are more effective than other approaches to instruction. We also discuss how embedding a well specified theory in our instructional software allows us to dynamically evaluate the effectiveness of our instruction at a more detailed level than was previously possible. The current widespread use of the software is allowing us to test hypotheses across large numbers of students. We believe that this will lead to new approaches both to understanding mathematical cognition and to improving instruction.},

	Abstract = {To improve our understanding of novice students' production of symbolic algebraic expressions, this article contrasts students' presymbolic and symbolic procedures in generalizing activities. Although a significant amount of previous research on the learning of algebra has dealt with students' errors in the mastering of the algebraic syntax, the semiotic cultural theoretical approach presented here focuses on the role that body, discourse, and signs play when students' refer to mathematical objects. Three types of generalizations are identified: factual, contextual, and symbolic. The results suggest that the passage from presymbolic to symbolic generalizations re- quires a specific kind of rupture with the ostensive gestures and contextually based key linguistic terms underpinning presymbolic generalizations. This rupture means a disembodiment of the students' previous spatial temporal embodied mathematical experience.},

	Abstract = {Computational models of analogy have assumed that the strength of an inductive inference about the target is based directly on similarity of the analogs and in particular on shared higher order relations. In contrast, work in philosophy of science suggests that analogical inference is also guided by causal models of the source and target. In 3 experiments, the authors explored the possibility that people may use causal models to assess the strength of analogical inferences. Experiments 1-2 showed that reducing analogical overlap by eliminating a shared causal relation (a preventive cause present in the source) from the target increased inductive strength even though it decreased similarity of the analogs. These findings were extended in Experiment 3 to cross-domain analogical inferences based on correspondences between higher order causal relations. Analogical inference appears to be mediated by building and then running a causal model. The implications of the present findings for theories of both analogy and causal inference are discussed.},

	Annote = {Jean's paper is in my opinion a powerful radical departure from the way teaching is view in the main stream. Her emphasis is on learning in context. The student/teacher relationship becomes the apprentice/master relationship. Her ideas were derived from her ethnographic studies of Tailors in the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia in the 70s. As I read this, I think of Temple Grandin, this seemed the way she learnt according to HBO's version of her biopic. Temple saw life the way animals saw it, from the context of the animal so she was able to design better ranching processes. Jean believes that American schools are an experience in enculturation into ``Americaness,'' and teachers should erase the boundaries between themselves and their students and should see each other as tutors.

Each model represents what is true in a possibility. A conclusion is held to be valid if it holds in all the models of the premises. Recent evidence described here shows that the fewer models an inference calls for, the easier the inference is. Errors arise because reasoners fail to consider all possible models, and because models do not normally represent what is false, even though reasoners can construct counterexamples to refute invalid conclusions.},

They propose that children use specialized cognitive systems that allow them to recover an accurate "causal map" of the world: an abstract, coherent, learned representation of the causal relations among events. This kind of knowledge can be perspicuously understood in terms of the formalism of directed graphical causal models, or Bayes nets. Children's causal learning and inference may involve computations similar to those for learning causal Bayes nets and for predicting with them. Experimental results suggest that 2- to 4-year-old children construct new causal maps and that their learning is consistent with the Bayes net formalism.},

What causal role, then, does knowledge of the language of counting serve? We consider the strong Whorfian proposal, that of linguistic determinism; the weak Whorfian hypothesis, that language influences how we think; and that the "language of thought" maps to spoken language or symbol systems.},

A coordination class is a particular kind of concept whose structure exhibits a complex system of many elements and kinds of knowledge. Coordination class theory provides a vocabulary concerning knowledge and knowledge construction that is particularly useful in considering transfer. This perspective reveals entirely comprehensible reasons why some types of transfer are relatively easy and ubiquitous, while others may be quite difficult. We question the assumption that high-level abstractness is the principal quality of knowledge that provides for its applicability across diverse situations, and we explain why theories purporting to explain transfer must be held accountable for describing and determining knowledge---not merely successful or unsuccessful performance.},

It talks about the nature of knowledge transfer and the impact of the conditions of the transfer test; particularly the temporal elements of transfer. He then gives a review of literature that deals with coordination class. Coordination class is a knowledge in pieces approach. He talks about how transfer is demonstrated in coordination classes. ``Coordination class theory shows how a concept can become robust enough so that it is applicable fluently across a wide range of situations (Class A transfer). In addition, the microstructure of development of coordination classes---for example, the incorporation or displacement of prior knowledge---constitutes a second embedding of a different sort of transfer (Class C transfer).''},

	Abstract = {Cumulative experience with a variety of symbolic artifacts has been hypothesized as a source of young children's increasing sensitivity to new symbol-referent relations. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from transfer studies showing that experience with a relatively easy symbolic retrieval task improves performance on a more difficult task. Significant transfer was found for the 2(1/2)-year-old children in the 3 studies reported here, even with relatively low levels of contextual support (according to the taxonomy of transfer by Barnett \& Ceci, 2002). Transfer occurred even though the 2 tasks were encountered in very different settings and there was a prolonged (1-week) delay interval between them. Transfer also occurred to a much more difficult task (one that even 3-year-olds typically fail).},

What is unique to this investigation is its multivariate nature. While others have studied these variables in isolation, our study looks at them collectively to identify important interactions among variables. This will eventually allow us to identify a profile of women who pursue careers in CS. The findings are reported in detail below. Particularly noteworthy is that men had more confidence in using computers than did women even when statistically controlling quantitative ability. In fact, female CS majors had less computer confidence than did male non-majors!},

Instead, grounded cognition proposes that modal simulations, bodily states, and situated action underlie cognition. Accumulating behavioral and neural evidence supporting this view is reviewed from research on perception, memory, knowledge, language, thought, social cognition, and development. Theories of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are origins of the area and common misperceptions of it. Theoretical, empirical, and methodological issues are raised whose future treatment is likely to affect the growth and impact of grounded cognition.},

@article{Scott01092013,
	Abstract = {This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls (N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program---entitled COMPUGIRLS---assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74%) and African American (19%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students' vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls' voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls' sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.},

	Abstract = {In the midst of discussions about improving education, teacher education, equity, and diversity, little has been done to make pedagogy a central area of investigation. This article attempts to challenge notions about the intersection of culture and teaching that rely solely on microanalytic or macroanalytic perspectives. Rather, the article attempts to build on the work done in both of these areas and proposes a culturally relevant theory of education. By raising questions about the location of the researcher in pedagogical research, the article attempts to explicate the theoretical framework of the author in the nexus of collaborative and reflexive research. The pedagogical practices of eight exemplary teachers of African-American students serve as the investigative ``site.'' Their practices and reflections on those practices provide a way to define and recognize culturally relevant pedagogy.},

@book{Papert1980,
	Address = {New York, NY},
	Annote = {"My interest is in the process of invention of 'objects to think with,' objects in which there is an intersection of cultural presence, embedded knowledge, and the possibility of personal identification." Seymour 

Papert believed in "object to think with." For him gears were the objs to think with. For me these are hip hop. 

He felt like education should have cultural resonance, should be something the student can intuitively grasp, should be sensorimotor, they can think with their bodies with it and so on. Pg 11.

Gears
  1. part of natural landscape embedded in culture around him
  2. world of adults around him
  3. could use his body to think about them
  4. relationship between gears contain math, so can use them to think of formal systems.
  5. serve as an object   t to think with as Ed researcher


Programming is power. when u learn to program, d process of learning is transformed from one where you are consuming information and explanations that someone else has created to one where you are the creator of your own knowledge. You become the epistemologist. Student as creator of learning and knowledge. That is powerful. It about liberating the student from the power structure that currently exists in most formal education settings. Emancipating the student. Giving agency to the student. Who best to give that kind of agency to, than those that have been most marginalized.

Combinatorial thinking
Self-Referential thinking about thinking.
Having an object to think with.

	Abstract = {We recommend using the term Computation in conjunction with a well-defined model of computation whose semantics is clear and which matches the problem being investigated. Computer science already has a number of useful clearly defined models of computation whose behaviors and capabilities are well understood. We should use such models as part of any definition of the term computation. However, for new domains of investigation where there are no appropriate models it may be necessary to invent new formalisms to represent the systems under study.},

	Abstract = {
               This study investigated the efficacy of signifying, a form of social discourse in the African American community, as a scaffold for teaching skills in literary interpretation. Specifically, the hypotheses of this study were that skill in signifying and prior knowledge about social conventions, themes, and values on which the instructional texts were based would positively influence skill in interpreting fiction. Prior to instruction, two tests were administered to measure prior social knowledge and skill in signifying. Pretest and posttest essay exams were administered to test progress in literal and inferential reading categories. Rasch scale analysis was used to calibrate the tests and to estimate person measures. Six classes of average level seniors from two high schools in a large midwestern urban district participated in the project: 4 experimental classes and 2 control or no-treatment classes. The majority of students, however, scored below national norms on standardized reading tests. The experimental group achieved a statistically significant mean gain over the control group. The experimental group achieved statistically significant gain in two of the inferential reading categories. Signifying and prior social knowledge measures showed statistically significant correlations with achievement at both the pretests and posttests.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the impact of implementing three systemic practices on the diversity and institutional culture in biomedical and public health PhD training at Brown University. We hypothesized that these practices, designed as part of the National Institutes of Health--funded Initiative to Maximize Student Development (IMSD) program in the Division of Biology and Medicine, would have a positive effect on underrepresented minority (URM) recruitment and retention and objective measures of student success. These practices include: 1) develop strategic partnerships with selected undergraduate institutions; 2) provide a personalized education program of student support and skill-based modules to supplement discipline-based course work; and 3) transform institutional culture by engaging faculty in supporting diversity-related goals and practices. Data comparing URM numbers and key academic milestones before and after implementation of IMSD practices support the initial hypothesis and effectiveness of these practices at Brown. Program components are broadly applicable as best practices for others seeking to improve URM recruitment and achievements of graduate students traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.},

	Abstract = {In the study described here, 65 prospective computer or information science majors worked through a tutorial on the basics of Perl. Eighteen students were African American. All actions were recorded and time-stamped, allowing us to investigate the relationship among six factors that we believed would predict performance in an introductory computer science (CS) course (as measured by course grade) and how much students would learn from the tutorial (as measured by the difference between pre-test and post-test performance). These factors are: preparation (SAT score, number of previous CS courses taken, and pretest score), time spent on the tutorial as a whole and on individual chapters, amount and type of experimentation, programming accuracy and/or proficiency, approach to materials that involve mathematical formalisms, and approach to learning highly unfamiliar material (pattern-matching procedures). Gender and race differences with respect to these factors were also investigated.},

Results indicate that physical science/engineering (PS/E) majors are dominated by men, but not, however, disproportionately by White men. After accounting for high school preparation, the odds of declaring a PS/E major are two times greater for Black males than for White males, and Black females are closer than White females to closing the gap with White males. The authors find virtually no evidence that math attitudes contribute to disparities in choice of a PS/E major. Finally, in contrast to PS/E fields, biological sciences draw relatively equitably from all groups.},

	Abstract = {Many young African American males have a passion for video games, but they don't often translate that passion into learning about computing. Part of the problem is that they do not identify with computing as a social norm within their peer group. This disidentification with computing can negatively impact academic performance and limit opportunities for upward mobility. We developed a job training program called Glitch Game Testers in which young African American men are trained to 'Sbreak open the black box' of their game consoles to learn about computing. Perceptions of peers' technical competency were measured before and after the summer 2010 program. Results showed that participants were more likely to view their peers as technical resources and their overall access to technical resources increased. Broader implications for motivating technology adoption in HCI are discussed.},

This situates the problem of under-representation in the framework of racial identity and culture instead of access and socioeconomic status.


The developed a measure of "technical capital" liken to social capital network. They took from social sciences ego-network and developed an approach that tried to capture the extent of technology capital (Know people who knew about technology and such) the students had in their network. 

Why did they do this? Because they wanted to measure social norms. 
The crux of the article is "contextualizing computing in an authentic job and game testing setting---both of which wield social status---builds participants' interest in promoting this identity."},

	Abstract = {Past work has documented and described major patterns of adaptive and maladaptive behavior: the mastery-oriented and the helpless patterns. In this article, we present a research-based model that accounts for these patterns in terms of underlying psychological processes. The model specifies how individuals' implicit theories orient them toward particular goals and how these goals set up the different patterns. Indeed, we show how each feature (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) of the adaptive and maladaptive patterns can be seen to follow directly from different goals. We then examine the generality of the model and use it to illuminate phenomena in a wide variety of domains. Finally, we place the model in its broadest context and examine its implications for our understanding of motivational and personality processes.

	Abstract = {A theory of analogy must describe how the meaning of an analogy is derived from the meanings of its parts. In the structure-mapping theory, the interpretation rules are characterized as implicit rules for mapping knowledge about a base domain into a target domain. Two important features of the theory are (a) the rules depend only on syntactic properties of the knowledge representation, and not on the specific content of the domains; and (b) the theoretical framework allows analogies to be distinguished cleanly from literal similarity statements, applications of abstractions, and other kinds of comparisons. Two mapping principles are described: (a) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target; and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systematicity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations. },

	Abstract = {Creativity assessment has been proposed as a supplement to intellectual testing, in part because of reduced differences by ethnicity; creativity testing might also specifically help reduce stereotype threat. Recent trends in creativity research point to a domain-specific view challenging the more traditional generalist view. With these trends in mind, the current study assessed creative self-perceptions of 3553 students and community members in 56 different possible domains distributed across five factors (as determined by principal components analysis). African Americans were less likely to fall prone to gender stereotypes in creativity. In addition, African Americans and Native Americans tended to rate themselves as more creative than other ethnicities. Specific trends in the factors and implications for future research are discussed. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Underground hip hop is critical hip hop.


She posits that hip hop has a conceptual system made up of several concepts
(1) Game Cluster

(2) Science Cluster
	recording studios are referred to as the "labs" where the scientists convene to experiment with rhetoric and rhythm.

(3) Battle/Struggle Cluster
	Emcees see themselves as warriors who battle against cultural exigencies such as racism, black disunity, the spread of AIDS and police brutality. So who are they battling against? Sometimes against one another in the cipher, against commercial nonsense rap, sometimes against the forces that are trying to pull them down and so on. The Emcee is the soldier and his weapon are his words.

(4) Life Cluster

What is computational thinking? Why did this article resonate with so many and serve as a rallying cry for educators, education researchers, and policy makers? How have they interpreted Wing's definition, and what advances have been made since Wing's article was published? This article frames the current state of discourse on computational thinking in K--12 education by examining mostly recently published academic literature that uses Wing's article as a springboard, identifies gaps in research, and articulates priorities for future inquiries.},

	Abstract = {Humans appear to be able to learn new concepts without needing to be programmed explicitly in any conventional sense. In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems.},

@article{Resnick2009,
	Annote = {Summary:
A multi-media editing tool that allows users to learn programming designed exclusively to address the problem of disindentification with cs culture.

Their primary goal is not to prepare people for careers as professional programmers, but rather to nurture the development of a new generation of creative, systematic thinkers who are comfortable using programming to express their ideas. They want to design a language with very low floor, low ceiling and wide walls to allow for diverse thinking and exploration of the tool.


The community is a very important part of Scratch education. Where kids can learn code reuse, collaboration and so on. That is a definite strength of Scratch. 







Commentary:
 So they designed it for kids to pretty much have fun. it was not designed for the student who is interested in a career as a computer scientist, for those kids scratch can be used to onboard, but then they need to move on to other languages. In my opnion, l wouldn't use it for a college course, I personally won't even use it past middle school.

	Annote = {(1) This paper did two things side by side, taught cs along side music concepts.
(2) It was not computational thinking in context


Critics: (STOTSKY, S. What's at Stake in the K-12 Standards Wars. Peter Lang, New York, 2000.)
	Often say interdiscplinary education waters down the "traditional" mathematical concepts because non-math or science material serves as a distraction. They say "However, we believe that our approach differed significantly from the ap- proaches being criticized, in particular, because the music complemented the computer science rather than dumbing it down."
	Said this approach help the students to care about the CS concepts. (MOTIVATE STUDENTS TOWARDS CS)

Musicomputation - Focuses on Mathematical Concepts rather than a particular programming language.

How does this differ from say LOGO or Alice?
	The main goal of these systems (as well as camps and classes that use these systems) is to get kids to have fun programming in these environments. Unfortu- nately, basic computer science is not covered in the pro- cess, and in some cases, would be difficult to cover.

I thought the focus was on learning the programming language, but I am beginning to think that it is not.

For example, the design of innovative curricularmaterials and pedagogical approaches is often aimed at help- ing students develop robust understandings that will generalize to decisionmaking and problem solving in other situations, both inside and outside the classroom. Other instructional approaches are aimed at improving the chances that later learn- ing ismaximized.However, researchers'progress in understanding and supporting the generalization of learning has been limited due tomethodological and theoreti- cal problems with the transfer construct.},

There is little agreement about the nature of transfer, the extent to which it occurs, and the nature of the underlying mechanisms. The detractors have issue with the transfer metaphor and the idea of abstraction as an assessment of transfer. Scholars like Lave have said that abstraction is epistemologically incompatible with situativity.},

	Abstract = {Finding ways to build on the language abilities students of diverse cultures bring to school, this book recounts an experiment in helping urban African American high school students to interpret literature by drawing on their own rich oral tradition of "signifying." The book defines signifying as a contest in which the most imaginative user of indirection, irony, and insult wins. The book describes a literature unit taught with inquiry and discussion methods under typical urban conditions in two high schools. The book reports that the academically marginal students posted statistically significant gains in using new awareness of metaphoric language to interpret complex relationships in literature. Chapters of the book are: The Problem; Rationale; Signifying in African American Fiction; Prior Research on Culture and Comprehension; Research Design and Implementation; Measurement Instruments; Observations of the Instructional Process; Results; Talk in the Classroom: The Transformation of Signifying; and Implications and Final Thoughts. Technical notes, reading tests, and tests of social and linguistic knowledge are attached. (Contains over 200 references.) (RS)},

@article{Karpicke2011,
	Abstract = {Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.},

@article{Cheryan2009,
	Abstract = {People can make decisions to join a group based solely on exposure to that group's physical environment. Four studies demonstrate that the gender difference in interest in computer science is influenced by exposure to environments associated with computer scientists. In Study 1, simply changing the objects in a computer science classroom from those considered stereotypical of computer science (e.g., Star Trek poster, video games) to objects not considered stereotypical of computer science (e.g., nature poster, phone books) was sufficient to boost female undergraduates' interest in computer science to the level of their male peers. Further investigation revealed that the stereotypical broadcast a masculine stereotype that discouraged women's sense of ambient belonging and subsequent interest in the environment (Studies 2, 3, and 4) but had no similar effect on men (Studies 3, 4). This masculine stereotype prevented women's interest from developing even in environments entirely populated by other women (Study 2). Objects can thus come to broadcast stereotypes of a group, which in turn can deter people who do not identify with these stereotypes from joining that group.},

@article{Ansari2006,
	Abstract = {Recently there has been growing interest in and debate about the relation between cognitive neuroscience and education. Our goal is to advance the debate beyond both recitation of potentially education-related cognitive neuroscience findings and the claim that a bridge between fields is chimerical. In an attempt to begin a dialogue about mechanisms among students, educators, researchers and practitioner-scientists, we propose that multiple bridges can be built to make connections between education and cognitive neuroscience, including teacher training, researcher training and collaboration. These bridges--concrete mechanisms that can advance the study of mind, brain and education--will benefit both educators and cognitive neuroscientists, who will gain new perspectives for posing and answering crucial questions about the learning brain.},
